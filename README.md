## Presentation

I'm currently learning front-end development, and here you can see my projects! The app is coded in React, with the help of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The first one is a tic tac toe game, with 2 interesting functionalities: a history to practice your strategy, and a local storage to pick up your game from last time :)

The second one will be a button maker: you'll be able to customize the text, the size, the shape and the colors of your button.

## Using this repo

Initially, you need to install the required packages: from the repo execute `npm install`.

Then to run the app in development mode, use `npm start`. You should be able to view it in you browser at the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To perform the preparatory tasks required for production, use `npm run build`.
